The Laboratory of Automation and Robotics is a Research and Development Laboratory at the University of Minho. A multidisciplinary research team that consists of Professors, PhD and Master's Students and Researchers involved in the development of numerous mobile and autonomous robotics projects. From robots that play soccer to robots that aid in day-to-day household and healthcare chores, knowledge from Electronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science are used to introduce novel robotics solutions. MinhoTeam is the competitive branch of LAR that focuses on competing and benchmarking its robots in international competitions.

## Projects

During the years the Laboratory of Automation and Robotics developed and integrated projects in a wide range of areas, such as Agriculture, Healthcare, Domestic Assistance, Social, Industrial and Sportive. The main focus lies on autonomous mobile robotics. However, different problems led to different robotic approaches. Quadcopters, Hexapod Robots, Omnidirectional Platforms, Robotic Arms are some examples of fully described projects LAR presents. In recent projects, the Laboratory has deepened its work regarding Machine Learning.
